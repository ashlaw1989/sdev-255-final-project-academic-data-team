# SDEV 255 Final Project – Spring 2026, Ivy Tech

## Project Overview
This project is a web app for managing college courses. Teachers can create, edit, and delete courses, while students can browse courses and manage their schedules. The app will have role-based functionality, with different actions available depending on whether the user is a teacher or a student. Stage 1 focuses on backend logic and basic course management, and Stage 2 adds login, role differentiation, and student course enrollment features.

## Stage 1
- Define course model and establish mock data
- Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete courses
- Courses include the following fields: name, description, subject, credits, course number, and instructor

## Stage 2
- Implement user login and authentication system
- Differentiate roles: student vs teacher
- Teachers can add or drop courses from the available listings
- Students can add or drop courses from their personal schedules
- Students can view all courses in which they are currently enrolled
